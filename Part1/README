-------------------- HOW TO USE --------------------

tagger1 has two options

Option1 - Train new model
    >> tagger1 --train path_to_train_file path_to_dev_file num_epochs model_name

    the program will create a model(according to assignment demands) and train it over the train file
    after training the model according to given parameters the program will create a pkl file for the model called
    - model_name

    for example:
    >> tagger1 --train ./../data/pos/train ./../data/pos/dev 50 my_model                    output: my_model

Option1 - Predict using existing model
    >> tagger1 --pred path_to_test_file model_name out_file_name
    the program simply uses the file model_name to give predictions over the input file
    the program outputs predictions file called:
    -  out_file_name

    for example:
    >> tagger1 --pred ./../data/pos/test my_model test1.pos                                 output: test1.pos



--NOTE--
# train files available in data dir
# there is a trained model file called part1_model, it was trained over ../data/train
